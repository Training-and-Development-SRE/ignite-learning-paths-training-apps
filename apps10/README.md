# APPS10: Options for Building and Running Your App in the Cloud  

[![Learning Path](https://img.shields.io/badge/Learning%20Path-APPS-fe5e00?logo=microsoft)](https://github.com/microsoft/ignite-learning-paths-training-apps)

## Session Abstract

Weâ€™ll show you how Tailwind Traders avoided a single point of failure, using cloud services to deploy their company website to multiple regions. Weâ€™ll cover all the options they considered, explain how and why they made their decisions, then dive into the components of their implementation.  

In this session, youâ€™ll see how they used Microsoft technologies like VS Code, Azure Portal, and Azure CLI to build a secure application that runs and scales on Linux and Windows VMs and Azure Web Apps, with a companion phone App.
